# hugo-homebrewery

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Module that repackages some of [The Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/)
assets.

The goal is to allow usage of Homebrewery assets (look and feel) within Hugo sites, so that a Markdown+ file created via [The Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) or compatible tooling can be published without effort. This doesn't including in-site editing capabilities.

It is still work in progress, particularly to reduce pollution from Legacy themes and asseets or editing related functionality, ensure only valid licensed assets are made available via the module, minimise the imported size and foster reusability across different Hugo sites.
